### Aircraft sizing tool
For now basic aircraft sizing is available
- generally piston airplanes with options for jet (although without SL equivalent)
- Save/Load feature
- values inside are from Gudmundsson GA Aircraft Design Examples (converted from his imperial units where needed)
- atmosphere model is based on freely available US Standard Atmosphere 1976
- can take in [m] or [ft] for altitudes, and [m/s] or [kn] for airspeeds
- Cost analysis according to heavily modified DAPCA-IV model
